# Mail System

## Decription
It is an email web application where users on the platform can send mail to one another. It lets the users to erase, archive, reply, and send new email chains.

### Technology
- Django Framework
- Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- NoSQL
I have previous experience using both Python and the Flask framework figured I would have skills that would carry over into Django. The reason behind Javascript, HTML, CSS, and 
Bootstrap is because they worked very well with Django's tempalate system.

### Struggle Faced
- Fetching previous emails that uers have sent in a email chain, and displaying in the correct order.
- Keeping a consistent visual design over the all aspects of the application.
